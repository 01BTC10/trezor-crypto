MicroECDSA
==========

Heavily optimized ECDSA (secp256k1) signer for embedded devices.

Distibuted under MIT License.

Notes
-----

a) the signer only understands secp256k1 elliptic curve

b) unit tests using Check (check.sf.net) are in tests.c

c) tests against OpenSSL are in test-openssl.c

d) directory speed-stm32 contains project for deploying the code
   on STM32 microcontroller and checking signing speed there
