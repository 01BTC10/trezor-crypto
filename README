MicroECDSA
==========

Heavily optimized ECDSA (secp256k1) signer for embedded devices.

Distibuted under MIT License.

Notes
-----

a) the signer only understands secp256k1 elliptic curve

b) random generator in rand.c is using stdlib's rand() function.
   you should replace this code with one that uses a hardware random
   generator of your microcontroller in production.
   (see speed-stm32/rand.c for such example)
