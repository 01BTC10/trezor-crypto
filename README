Heavily optimized cryptography algorithms for embedded devices.

These include:
- Big Number (256 bit) Arithmetics
- BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
- Blowfish encrypt/decrypt
- ECDSA signer/verifier (only secp256k1 curve)
- ECDSA public key derivation and Base58 address representation
- HMAC-SHA256 and HMAC-SHA512
- RIPEMD-160
- SHA256/SHA512
- unit tests (using Check - check.sf.net; in tests.c)
- tests against OpenSSL (in test-openssl.c)
