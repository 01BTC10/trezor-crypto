MicroECDSA
==========

Heavily optimized ECDSA (secp256k1) signer for embedded devices.

Distibuted under MIT License.

Notes
-----

a) the signer only understands secp256k1 elliptic curve

b) there are executables:
   * test-rfc6979
     - check RFC 6979 algorithm for generating deterministic K
   * test-speed
     - check signing speed (sign 100x and compute speed from duration)
   * test-verify
     - generate random messages and private keys
     - check signature validity against OpenSSL (call verify method)

c) directory speed-stm32 contains project for deploying the code
   on STM32 microcontroller and checking signing speed there
